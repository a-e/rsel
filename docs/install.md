Installation
============

To install Rsel from a gem:

    $ gem install rsel

Rsel drives browser actions through Selenium Server, so you will need to download
[selenium-server-standalone-x.x.x.jar](http://seleniumhq.org/download/), and start
it up like this before running any Rsel scripts:

    $ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-x.x.x.jar
